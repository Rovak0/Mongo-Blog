# Mongo-Blog

## Description 
This is the back end to a blog written in javascript using a mongo database.  

## Usage
The blog only runs on local host (it likely could run hosted on a server), so if you want to run it you will have to create your own copy and run it on your own server.  As mentioned in the description, this is only a back end, so to actually use the "blog" you will need to use an app like insomnia to send requests to the server.

## Contributing
This is just the back end to a blog, so if you want to do something with this, feel free to make a front end that connects with this.
